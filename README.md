Good Phone Numbers
==================

A simple JavaScript program to sort a bunch of phone numbers, based on how "good" they are. Numbers get better scores if they have lots of same numbers that are adjacent to each other.

Check `example.html` for an example on how to use it.

This is implementation is done in JavaScript, but porting it to any language should be trivial. There's nothing JavaScript-specific about it.
